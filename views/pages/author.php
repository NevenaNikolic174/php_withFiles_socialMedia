            I am Nevena NikoliÄ‡, a 23 year old student that is currently studying 
            Web programming module on the Internet technologies, a part of the ICT College in Serbia.
            I come from Pancevo, a city near the capital city of Serbia Belgrade, where i finished 
            elementary and high school. By enrolling in ICT my decision to tinker with computers was 
            my way to set a stable future for me, right now in the specter of Web, and who knows what
            tomorrow. By now i have 3 projects that helped me hone the knowledge that i currently hold, 
            and use on my websites.
            <br><br> &#60;/hello&#62;
